    Instructions on how to compile and run code:

    - To compile, type: "make"

    - To run, type: "./main"

    - To clean, type: "make clean"

    Pointer Practice:

    1d. 8
    1e. 4
    1f. 8
    1g. 8
    1h. 8

    Trial 1:
    2a. 0x7ffd08cb723c
    2b. 0x7ffd08cb7240
    2c. 0x7ffd08cb7244
    2d. 0x7ffd08cb7248
    2e. 0x7ffd08cb724c
    Trial 2:
    2a. 0x7fff2bf6cd5c
    2b. 0x7fff2bf6cd60
    2c. 0x7fff2bf6cd64
    2d. 0x7fff2bf6cd68
    2e. 0x7fff2bf6cd6c
    Trial 3:
    2a. 0x7ffc6af4557c
    2b. 0x7ffc6af45580
    2c. 0x7ffc6af45584
    2d. 0x7ffc6af45588
    2e. 0x7ffc6af4558c

    2f. The outputs are different. There is a new memory address for each variable after each
    run, thus the memory addresses printed are also different.
